# Starbucks Coffee made with JetpackCompose UI Toolkit
I have implemented Tugboi's design using Jetpack Compose . (https://www.uplabs.com/posts/starbucks-d6f47b84-e562-43d7-8bec-2779592942d9) 

Jetpack Compose is a Kotlin first UI toolkit which simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android.
Check it out tearn how to use some of Compose functions to build a custom UI like Layouts, Spacing, Size , Fonts ..etc.

Note: Jetpack Compose is currently in Developer Preview. The API surface is not yet finalized, and changes are planned and expected.
